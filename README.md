## Interactive Wellness App "Nook Daily"

[Nook Daily](https://nookdaily.vercel.app/) is a wellness app inspired by Animal Crossing. Users receive daily tasks and earn Nook Mile Tickets (NMT) for completing them. NMTs can be redeemed for personal rewards like guilt-free naps, social events, or favorite meals.

[Nook Daily](https://nookdaily.vercel.app/) uses Next.js, TypeScript, Material UI.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.

This project uses [`React Slick`](https://react-slick.neostack.com/) for the Task carousel.

## Project Goals

-   Create an app that focuses on color, wellness, and animation.

-   Learn new technologies/techniques like useContext, useReducer, useMemo, svg creation, advanced keyframe animation, and local storage.

-   Learn Adobe Illustrator for SVG creation and create all assets from scratch.

-   Improve skills in familiar technologies such as Next.js, Typescript, css modules, React, and Yarn.

## Scripts

```bash
yarn install
# installs all dependencies listed in package.json and generates a yarn.lock file.

yarn dev
# launch development server with live reloading, updates, and debugging.

yarn build
# create an optimized, production-ready version of the app.

yarn start
# launch development server and run project locally.

yarn outdated
# display a list of dependencies with newer versions available, showing current, wanted, and latest versions for each package.
```
